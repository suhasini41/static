Static :
-----------
Static is a keyword in Java. We can create a static block, static variable or a static method. When a member is made static, it is associated with the class
and not to the object of the class. So when a member is made static, only one copy of it is created and is shared by all instances of that class.
The static concept is used for the memory management.
